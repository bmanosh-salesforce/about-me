An intro to Git
* Open the terminal
* cd to a working directory
* Pull the repo from the remote location to get the latest version (a pull is the equivalent to a fetch, followed by a merge)
* Checkout the branch you want to work in
* Make changes you want to make
* git add . to add all the changes to staging
* git commit -m 'some message here' to commit the changes
* git push to push the changes back up to the remote repo
